# Demo M68K

This is a simple demo of a M68K emulator that can be launched on
[asim-reborn](https://github.com/GoldenPalazzo/asim-reborn).

At the time of writing (13/06/2024), the emulator suffers from great physical
limitations, such as the lack of a VSync on the screen and performance issues
when running a program at full speed. Nonetheless, I'm really proud for what I
did in about 4 weeks of work.

It only started as a simple project to recreate the programs I wrote during my
classes at the university, but now I know it can become something even better.

Probably I will expand it further in the future, but for now I will keep it as
it is and take a break from coding in general.

## How to run

Simply run `plasma.a68` on the emulator and turn on the screen.
